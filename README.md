## About this project

Okay, free tier Heroku projects died. Legends like meme-api and akaneko all died of a sudden while I was looking back at Neko's code and opening a few links and thought it's just a normal downtime.

Until I read that notice in my Gmail inbox...

Fair, I need a meme API real quick to smash it into my bot's code (akaneko has its own new domain now), else things would collapse. And here it is, this repository has been created for that purpose.

The code is just so short and easy to make, so I made it beautiful and easy to read. Else if I wanted to make this hard to read I'd just use an obfuscator.

## Instructions on hosting
I was thinking of using some sort of Reddit API and something something but the idea was silly. No keys is required, however you'll need:
- A hosting place. It's easy to find a free one, this project is small enough.
- `Node.js` and `npm` or `yarn` on that hosting place. It's either already in there or you'll have to set it up.
- A brain to process these instructions. Very important.

1/ If you have [git Command Line Interface](https://git-scm.com), clone this repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/harubarii/kokkei.git
```
If you don't, simply [download the zip file](https://github.com/harubarii/kokkei/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it yourself.

2/ `cd` into the directory
```sh
cd kokkei-main
```

3/ Install all required packages. I keep packages at a minimal rate so do not worry.
```sh
npm install
```
or, if you have `yarn` instead:
```sh
yarn install
```

4/ Make all necessary changes. Instructions are in `index.js`.

5/ Fire up the project:
```sh
node index.js
```
The API is available to use on your `localhost:<port>`, or, on the hosting place, the Public IP Address/Domain assigned to it. Main endpoint is `/gimme/random`, other information about this is also in the `index.js` file so make sure to read it throughoutly.
